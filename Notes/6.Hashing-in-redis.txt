ðŸ§© What is a Redis Hash?
--------------------------

A Hash in Redis is like a small object or dictionary â€” it stores data in a key:value format inside another key.

It's like this:

"user:1" = {
  "name": "Indura",
  "age": "25",
  "city": "Colombo"
}


So instead of one value, a hash holds many fields and values.

ðŸ”§ Why use hashes?
--------------------

You want to store structured data, like a user, product, or post.

Each "record" can have multiple fields.

âœ… Basic Hash Commands
---------------------------

1. HSET = Set a field in a hash

HSET user:1 name "Indura"
HSET user:1 age "25"
HSET user:1 city "Colombo"

Now user:1 looks like:

{
  "name": "Indura",
  "age": "25",
  "city": "Colombo"
}


2. HGET = Get one field

HGET user:1 name

Output:

"Indura"


3. HGETALL = Get all fields and values

HGETALL user:1

1) "name"
2) "Indura"
3) "age"
4) "25"
5) "city"
6) "Colombo"


. HDEL = Delete a field

HDEL user:1 city
Now city is gone.

5. HEXISTS = Check if a field exists

HEXISTS user:1 age

Returns:

1 if the field exists

0 if it doesn't

6. HSETNX = Set a field only if it doesnâ€™t exist

HSETNX user:1 name "SomeoneElse"
It wonâ€™t overwrite "Indura" because name already exists.

7. HINCRBY = Increase a numeric field

HSET user:1 score 10
HINCRBY user:1 score 5

Now score is 15.


ðŸ§  When to use Redis Hashes?
To store structured data:

Users

Products

Profiles

Instead of making lots of separate keys like:

user:1:name
user:1:age
user:1:city

Use one hash: user:1

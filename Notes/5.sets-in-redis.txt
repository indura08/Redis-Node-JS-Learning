🧺 What is a Redis Set?
---------------------------

A Set is like a basket of unique items.
You can add, remove, and check items — but no duplicates allowed.

Think of it like:

{"apple", "banana", "orange"}

Even if you try to add "apple" again, it won’t be added twice.


✅ Basic Set Commands
-----------------------

1. SADD = Add to a set

SADD fruits "apple"
SADD fruits "banana"
SADD fruits "orange"

Now fruits contains:

{"apple", "banana", "orange"}

If you do:

SADD fruits "apple"

Redis ignores it (because "apple" is already there).

2. SMEMBERS = Show all items in the set

SMEMBERS fruits

1) "apple"
2) "banana"
3) "orange"


Output:

Sets have no order — items come in random order.

3. SISMEMBER = Check if an item is in the set

SISMEMBER fruits "banana"

Returns:

1 if it’s there

0 if not

4. SREM = Remove an item from the set

SREM fruits "orange"

Now the set becomes:

{"apple", "banana"}



5. SCARD = Count how many items are in the set

SCARD fruits

Returns:

2


🔁 Set Operations (Optional, for when you're ready)
------------------------------------------------------

Sets in Redis can also do math-like operations like:

SINTER = Get common items from two sets

SUNION = Get all unique items from both sets

SDIFF = Get items in one set but not in another

Example:

SADD set1 "apple" "banana" "grape"
SADD set2 "banana" "grape" "melon"

SINTER set1 set2

# returns: "banana", "grape"

🧠 When to use Redis Sets?

When you need unique values

Checking membership quickly

Tag systems (e.g. users with a "premium" tag)

Online user tracking (who’s currently online)

🐂 What is Bull Queue?
------------------------

Bull Queue is a job queue system for Node.js that uses Redis to manage background tasks.

Think of it like:

A task manager where you add jobs, and workers process them one by one (or in batches), in the background.

🛠️ Why use Bull Queue?
------------------------

Because some tasks take time and shouldn't block your main app.

Example use cases:

Sending emails

Resizing images

Processing payments

Sending notifications

Data cleanup tasks

These are background jobs — Bull handles them for you, while your app stays fast.


📦 How Bull works (in simple terms)
--------------------------------------

You create a queue (example: emailQueue)

You add jobs to that queue (example: send welcome email)

You write a worker that handles the job (example: actually send the email)

Bull stores and manages all of this in Redis

📚 Key Terms
-------------

| Term   | Meaning                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue  | A list of jobs to be processed                          |
| Job    | One task to be done (e.g., send an email)               |
| Worker | The code that does the job (like a background function) |
| Redis  | Used by Bull to store queues and track job status       |


✅ Quick Example
------------------

1. Install Bull and Redis client

2. Create a Queue and Add a Job

const Queue = require('bull');

// create queue
const emailQueue = new Queue('email');

// add job
emailQueue.add({ to: 'user@example.com', subject: 'Hello!' });

3. Create a Worker

emailQueue.process(async (job) => {
  const { to, subject } = job.data;
  // Simulate sending email
  console.log(`Sending email to ${to} with subject "${subject}"`);
});


💡 What’s going on here?
---------------------------

emailQueue.add(...) → adds a job to Redis

emailQueue.process(...) → tells Bull how to handle jobs

🧠 What Redis does here?
--------------------------

Redis acts like a storage brain:

Keeps track of job status (waiting, active, failed, completed)

Stores job data

Handles retries, delays, priorities (all built into Bull)


🎯 Benefits of Bull Queue
----------------------------

Built-in retries if a job fails

Delayed jobs (run after X seconds)

Job priorities

Concurrency (run many jobs at once)

Events (on completed, failed, etc.)

📝 Summary
-------------

| Thing        | Example                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Create queue | `new Queue('myQueue')`            |
| Add job      | `queue.add({ my: 'data' })`       |
| Process job  | `queue.process((job) => { ... })` |
| Use Redis    | To track and manage all job data  |

🐂 What is Bull Queue?
------------------------

Bull Queue is a job queue system for Node.js that uses Redis to manage background tasks.

Think of it like:

A task manager where you add jobs, and workers process them one by one (or in batches), in the background.

🛠️ Why use Bull Queue?
------------------------

Because some tasks take time and shouldn't block your main app.

Example use cases:

Sending emails

Resizing images

Processing payments

Sending notifications

Data cleanup tasks

These are background jobs — Bull handles them for you, while your app stays fast.


📦 How Bull works (in simple terms)
--------------------------------------

You create a queue (example: emailQueue)

You add jobs to that queue (example: send welcome email)

You write a worker that handles the job (example: actually send the email)

Bull stores and manages all of this in Redis

📚 Key Terms
-------------

| Term   | Meaning                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue  | A list of jobs to be processed                          |
| Job    | One task to be done (e.g., send an email)               |
| Worker | The code that does the job (like a background function) |
| Redis  | Used by Bull to store queues and track job status       |


✅ Quick Example
------------------

1. Install Bull and Redis client

2. Create a Queue and Add a Job

const Queue = require('bull');

// create queue
const emailQueue = new Queue('email');

// add job
emailQueue.add({ to: 'user@example.com', subject: 'Hello!' });

3. Create a Worker

emailQueue.process(async (job) => {
  const { to, subject } = job.data;
  // Simulate sending email
  console.log(`Sending email to ${to} with subject "${subject}"`);
});


💡 What’s going on here?
---------------------------

emailQueue.add(...) → adds a job to Redis

emailQueue.process(...) → tells Bull how to handle jobs

🧠 What Redis does here?
--------------------------

Redis acts like a storage brain:

Keeps track of job status (waiting, active, failed, completed)

Stores job data

Handles retries, delays, priorities (all built into Bull)


🎯 Benefits of Bull Queue
----------------------------

Built-in retries if a job fails

Delayed jobs (run after X seconds)

Job priorities

Concurrency (run many jobs at once)

Events (on completed, failed, etc.)

📝 Summary
-------------

| Thing        | Example                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Create queue | `new Queue('myQueue')`            |
| Add job      | `queue.add({ my: 'data' })`       |
| Process job  | `queue.process((job) => { ... })` |
| Use Redis    | To track and manage all job data  |


🔶 Okay, but what does it do?
--------------------------------

The Bull queue holds a list of jobs/tasks (things to do later).
Each task sits in the queue until a worker picks it up and runs it.

Think of a bakery:

Customers (your code) place cake orders (jobs).

Orders are placed in a queue (Bull queue).

The baker (worker) picks each order, bakes the cake (processes the job), then moves to the next one.

📦 In Code: Creating a Queue
------------------------------

import Queue from 'bull';

const orderQueue = new Queue('order-queue', {
  redis: { port: 6379, host: '127.0.0.1' }
});

This line means:

Create a new queue named 'order-queue'

It stores jobs in Redis

You can now add jobs, and process them

📥 Adding a job to the queue
------------------------------

orderQueue.add(
  { userId: 1, productId: 99 },       // data
  { delay: 5000, attempts: 3 }        // options
);

You add a job (task) to the queue

The job has:

Data: The info to process

Options: Like delay, retry count, priority, etc.

Bull stores it in Redis

A worker will pick it up and process it

🔁 Queue Processing
--------------------

orderQueue.process(async (job) => {
  // Your logic to process job
  console.log(job.data); // { userId: 1, productId: 99 }
});


🧠 Is it like the classic queue data structure?

| Feature        | Classic Queue | Bull Queue       |
| -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| FIFO order     | ✅             | ✅                |
| Add task       | ✅ `enqueue()` | ✅ `.add()`       |
| Remove/Process | ✅ `dequeue()` | ✅ `.process()`   |
| Delays         | ❌             | ✅                |
| Retry          | ❌             | ✅                |
| Priority       | ❌             | ✅                |
| Persistence    | ❌             | ✅ Redis saves it |


🧩 Extra Things You Can Do with Bull Queues
---------------------------------------------

| Feature        | What it does                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.add()`       | Add a new job                                 |
| `.process()`   | Handle jobs when ready                        |
| `.on('event')` | Listen to job events (completed, failed, etc) |
| `.getJob(id)`  | Get a specific job by ID                      |
| `.remove()`    | Remove job from queue                         |
| Priorities     | Urgent jobs go first                          |
| Retries        | Retry failed jobs                             |
| Delays         | Schedule for later                            |
| Backoff        | Wait longer between retries                   |

🧪 Example
------------

const emailQueue = new Queue('email', {
  redis: { host: '127.0.0.1', port: 6379 }
});

emailQueue.add(
  { to: 'user@example.com' },
  { delay: 5000, attempts: 2 }
);

emailQueue.process(async (job) => {
  console.log(`Sending email to ${job.data.to}`);
});

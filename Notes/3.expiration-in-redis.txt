🕒 What is expiration in Redis?
---------------------------------

Expiration means:
"Store this data, but automatically delete it after some time."

Just like setting an expiry date on food — after that time, it’s gone.

🧪 Example:
--------------

SET session_token "abc123" EX 60

This saves "abc123" under the key "session_token".

The EX 60 part means: "expire after 60 seconds."

After 60 seconds, Redis will automatically delete it.


📦 Syntax Summary
--------------------

✅ EX = set time in seconds

SET mykey "hello" EX 10  # Expires in 10 seconds

✅ PX = set time in milliseconds

SET mykey "hello" PX 5000  # Expires in 5000 milliseconds (5 sec)

❓ How to check how much time is left?
---------------------------------------

Use TTL command (Time To Live):

TTL mykey

Returns:

Time left in seconds

-1 if key exists but has no expiry

-2 if key is already deleted

🧹 Why use expirations?
-------------------------

Login sessions (auto logout after 1 hour)

Verification codes (like OTP, valid for 2 minutes)

Cache (store data temporarily to avoid recomputing)

✅ Set expiry separately (optional)
-------------------------------------

You can also do it like this:

SET mykey "hi"
EXPIRE mykey 30

This sets mykey to expire in 30 seconds after it's created.

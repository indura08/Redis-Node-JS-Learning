ðŸ§± job is a single task (order) in the queue
---------------------------------------------

Whenever you add something to the queue, Bull turns it into a job object.

So job is:

The object representing that specific task

It contains data you passed to it

And metadata like id, number of attempts, status, etc.

âœ… Example
------------

Letâ€™s say you added a job like this:

await orderQueue.add(
  { userId: 123, productId: 45, quantity: 2 },
  {
    delay: 5000,
    attempts: 3,
    priority: 1
  }
);

When that job gets processed, this is what job will look like inside process():

job.data = { userId: 123, productId: 45, quantity: 2 }
job.id = 'abc123' (auto-generated by Bull)
job.attemptsMade = 0 (unless it failed before)
job.timestamp = 1690000000000 (when it was added)
job.opts = {
  delay: 5000,
  attempts: 3,
  priority: 1
}


ðŸ”§ In orderQueue.process((job) => {}):
-----------------------------------------

This runs when itâ€™s time to process the job (after delay).

So job here is:

The order you're processing

You use job.data to access info like userId, productId, etc.

const { userId, productId, quantity } = job.data;

Youâ€™re extracting info you passed when scheduling the job.

ðŸš¨ In orderQueue.on('failed', (job, err) => {}):
--------------------------------------------------

This runs if the job failed during processing.

The same job is passed here, so you can:

Check job.id

Check how many times it failed (job.attemptsMade)

Check what the job was about (job.data)

if (job.attemptsMade >= 3) {
  // Means the job was retried 3 times and failed every time
}

ðŸ§  Summary Table
-------------------

| Property           | What it means                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `job.data`         | The order data you passed in         |
| `job.id`           | Unique ID of the job (used in Redis) |
| `job.attemptsMade` | How many times it has failed         |
| `job.opts`         | Options like delay, priority, etc.   |


Commons job properties and methods:
-------------------------------------

âœ… job.id

The unique ID of the job.

Useful for checking status or cancelling.

Type: string | number

console.log(job.id);  // e.g., "45"

âœ… job.data
The data you passed when adding the job.

It's what you're processing.

// You added:
orderQueue.add({ userId: 123, productId: 99 });

// In the worker:
console.log(job.data.userId);  // 123

âœ… job.attemptsMade
Number of times the job has been retried so far.

Example:

if (job.attemptsMade === 3) {
  console.log("This job has failed 3 times.");
}
Used in:

queue.on('failed', async (job, err) => {
  if (job.attemptsMade >= 3) {
    // Log permanent failure
  }
});

âœ… job.getState()
Returns the current state of the job.

States include:

'waiting' â€” job is waiting in queue

'active' â€” currently being processed

'completed'

'failed'

'delayed'

'paused'

const state = await job.getState();
console.log(state);  // e.g., "delayed"

âœ… job.remove()
Deletes the job from the queue.

Used for cancellation:

await job.remove();

âœ… job.retry()
Retry the job manually (even if it's not auto-retrying).

await job.retry();

âœ… job.progress()
Get current progress info (you can update it too).

Helpful for long-running tasks.

Set progress:

job.progress(50);  // 50%
Get progress:

const progress = await job.progress();

âœ… job.finished()
Returns a Promise that resolves when the job finishes (success or failure).

await job.finished();  // useful in testing

âœ… job.update(data)
Updates the job data (not common but sometimes useful).

await job.update({ userId: 123, productId: 88 });

âœ… job.moveToCompleted() and job.moveToFailed()
Manually mark the job as completed or failed (you usually donâ€™t need this â€” Bull does it for you automatically).


| Property / Method  | What it does                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `job.id`           | Unique job ID                               |
| `job.data`         | Data passed into the job                    |
| `job.attemptsMade` | How many times it retried                   |
| `job.getState()`   | Returns job state (waiting, active, etc.)   |
| `job.remove()`     | Delete the job                              |
| `job.retry()`      | Manually retry the job                      |
| `job.progress()`   | Get/set progress of job                     |
| `job.finished()`   | Wait until job is done (resolved or failed) |
| `job.update(data)` | Replace the job data                        |




Final Thoughts
-------------------

job in .process() â†’ lets you handle each order

job in .on('failed') â†’ lets you track and react to failed jobs

You always access the order info using job.data

❓ What is Redis?
------------------

Redis is:

A small, super-fast database that stores data in your computer’s memory (RAM), not on the hard drive.

📦 Think of it like this:
---------------------------

Imagine Redis as a super-fast notebook that keeps information right on your desk, instead of storing it in a cabinet (like most databases do). Because it’s on your desk (RAM), you can grab things really quickly.


🔥 Key points in very simple words:

It stores key-value pairs
Like:

"username" = "Indura"
"score" = 100

Like a dictionary or object in code.

It stores data in memory (RAM)
So it’s really fast, but memory is limited.

It’s used for things like:

Caching (keeping data temporarily for fast access)

Session storage (user login info)

Queues (tasks lined up to be done one-by-one)

Real-time data (like leaderboards or chat)

It can store simple and complex data
Like strings, lists, sets, and even hashes (like JSON objects).


💡 Why use Redis?
--------------------

Speed – It's blazing fast.

Simplicity – Easy commands like SET and GET.

Useful for temporary or fast-changing data.
